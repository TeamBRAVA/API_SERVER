For the USER data in DB;


1) I think we should not keep

username and the password in DB withouth encryption

they should be kept in a token (in an ecrypted way).

So we shoud just have this;

user{

	_id: String,

	token:String,

	expirationdate: Number

}


In first sign-in operation, username and pass taken by angular front-end

webpage than they passed in API in a encrypted way (like a token) like;


router.post('/user/new'){

	var=newUser{

		userid: req.body.userid,

        	token (username:password): req.body.token,

        	expirationdate: req.body.expirationdate
		
	}

	....

	db.insertUser(newUser, callback);

	....
		

}


then in database this token (username:password) should be stored in token 

variable as mentioned above. So , with this way we never reveal the user credentials.


and


2) When we make a request to get user data, we should not pass (reveal) username in API

without encrypting it. We sould pass it in API as a token that we can decrypt the token to 

obtain the username to fetch the userdata.
